# Google vs. Apple App Store Analysis
By Logan Warren

## Install Requirements:
- streamlit
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly

## Usage:
The two datasets are split across 10 different parts. These are all within the same directory as the streamlit.py and will be combined when it is run. They are also still pretty big and it may take a minute to fully load all the data, however the data is cached and should only take long once per start.

To run my Streamlit, use: streamlit run .\appsStreamlit.py
